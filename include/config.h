// In the Generation 3 games, Asserts were used in various debug builds.
// Ruby/Sapphire and Emerald do not have these asserts while Fire Red
// still has them in the ROM. This is because the developers forgot
// to define NDEBUG before release, however this has been changed as
// Ruby's actual debug build does not use the AGBPrint features.
#define NDEBUG

// To enable print debugging, comment out "#define NDEBUG". This allows
// the various AGBPrint functions to be used. (See include/gba/isagbprint.h).
// Some emulators support a debug console window: uncomment NoCashGBAPrint()
// and NoCashGBAPrintf() in libisagbprn.c to use no$gba's own proprietary
// printing system. Use NoCashGBAPrint() and NoCashGBAPrintf() like you
// would normally use AGBPrint() and AGBPrintf().
